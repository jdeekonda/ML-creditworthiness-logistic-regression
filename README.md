# Predicting creditworthiness of financial client using logistic regression ML models

Basic Machine Learning project to demonstrate use of logistic regression to determine creditworthiness of client


Project will make use of several logistic regression models to train on data set and evaluate models using performance metrics.


## Project files:
**1. client_credit_worthiness_logistic_regression.ipynb :** Jupyter notebook with code to train and evaluate ML models.

**2. Credit_card.csv,Credit_card_label.csv :** Original data set containing client prospect personal data in one file and creditworthiness decision data in second file.

**3. final_joined_data.xlsx :** Dataset prepared from joining the above two files using MySQL workbench which will be used to train and test Machine Learning Models.

**4. credit_card_approval.sql :** SQL queries to prepare final data set from original data.
